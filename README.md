# Eleventykit

The Eleventykit is a very simple (unstyled) example for a site, built with [Kirby](https://getkirby.com) and [11ty](https://11ty.dev).

[Kirby’s query language (KQL)](https://github.com/getkirby/kql) is used to fetch articles from our KQL playground: https://kql.getkirby.com

Use your own Kirby installation with the KQL plugin to provide a powerful headless CMS for your static 11ty site.

## Installation

1. Clone or download the repo. 
2. Install dependencies
```
npm i
```
3. Serve the static site locally 
```
npm run serve
```
